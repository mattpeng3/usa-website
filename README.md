Website for the Statistics Undergraduate Student Association at Berkeley.

First, clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/usaberkeley/usa-website). 

If you are changing some code: 

- If a branch for your task does not already exist, create a branch for your job (git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME). 

- If a branch does already exist, switch to that branch (git checkout BRANCH_NAME). 

You can check what branch you're on by typing "git branch" or "git status". "git branch" will show you a list of all the branches that you can access.

When done updating code, type "git add -A", "git commit -m 'Enter commit message here'", and "git push origin BRANCH_NAME". 

Then visit the repository on your browser, click on "Pull requests" at the top of the page, then click "New pull request". Keep the base-branch as "master", but change the compare-branch to BRANCH_NAME. Then, click "Create pull request". Now wait for someone else to look through the edits to make sure nothing broke! Typos are a scary thing.
